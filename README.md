# Cypress-Docker-Integration
A repository showcasing how to integrate Cypress, the powerful end-to-end testing framework, with Docker. This example provides a step-by-step guide to running Cypress tests within a Docker container, enabling easy setup and consistent test environments. Improve your testing workflow with this Dockerized Cypress configuration.

Steps to execute : 
1. Clone the project by -git clone (url)
2. Pre-requisite--You must have docker desktop downloaded and running(if no you can download it from --https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
3. You can add your own testscript under e2e folder(if needed)
4. Run testscripts on local machine
5. Once done,now you can build your image/container
6. execute command - docker build . -t image-name:image-tag(imagename and imagetag can be given anything)
7. once image is creted by executing this command we can view image by executing command- docker images
8. List of all the images will be displayed look for the iamge you creted by image name and get the id of that image.
9. Now run the image by executing command -docker run imageid.
10. Done


With Docker, you can effortlessly address the age-old problem of "works on my machine" by ensuring consistent testing environments. When you run Cypress tests locally, the version of Node.js on your machine might differ from the one inside the Docker container. Docker allows you to encapsulate your testing environment, including the desired Node.js version, in a container, eliminating inconsistencies.

Running Cypress tests in Docker provides numerous advantages for DevOps teams and automated pipelines:

Consistency: Docker ensures that tests run in a consistent environment across all systems, mitigating unexpected behavior due to variations in configurations.

Portability: Containerized tests can be seamlessly moved between environments, ensuring identical results regardless of the host system.

Reproducibility: Docker's version-controlled setup guarantees that tests can be replicated precisely, minimizing discrepancies between environments.

Scalability: Dockerized Cypress tests can be seamlessly integrated into automated pipelines, enabling rapid, scalable, and reliable testing at every stage of the development process.

By embracing Docker for Cypress testing, you empower your DevOps teams to achieve greater reliability, efficiency, and seamless integration into continuous integration and deployment workflows.
